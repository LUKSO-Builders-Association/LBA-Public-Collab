# LBA Agenda

**Date**: Nov 12, 2024  
**Google Meet**: LBA Meeting Tuesday, Nov 5 · 2:00 – 3:00pm  
**Time zone**: America/New_York

## Points to be discussed

### Motivation

This group is formed to work and build in public to help grow LUKSO and attract builders with a common goal of uplifting our favourite pink chain. To improve the quality of our interaction I am proposing that we create a code of conduct, to abide by or be excluded **forever**. 

### Code of conduct

- All members that join LBA meetings should do so in a public manner when involved in weekly group calls, meaning anonymity is not welcomed, we want to insist on human interactions, no voice changers, no anon picture.
- If you don't agree with someone from this group or don't like someone from this group, you have to make that completely clear, without creating tension by sending cryptic messages via other groups or public social media posts. Hidden anomosity will not be overlooked and result in an instant/permament removal from the LBA.
- Spreading hate about other projects behind closed doors or in public while being part of the LBA will result in immediate action taken.
- Any form of critism should be met constructively in public chat of the LBA to help further our common goal of working together towards uplifting the LBA brand.
