# **LBA Code of Conduct**

This Code of Conduct establishes the standards for professionalism, transparency, and collaboration within the LBA.
It is designed to address previous challenges and ensure a respectful and productive environment for all members.
We strive for calm, rational, mature, successful, and data-driven collaboration that aims to change the world.
To achieve this impact, we must establish guiding principles for communication, so we work together, not against each other.

We set rules for communication and interaction that must be followed by every LBA member.

To ensure effective communication, the severity of violations is distinguished by the following key terms:

- "MUST":     Basic requirement.
              Violations will result in an incremental escalation.

- "SHOULD":   Optional requirement.
              This contributes to better cooperation and helps in community building.
              Violations will not result in escalation but serve as guidance for successful interpersonal collaboration.



Upon joining the LBA, previous and ongoing conflicts must be resolved immediately, as the LBA’s goal is progress in unity.
If necessary, a mediator should be involved, as participation in the LBA is excluded without meeting this basic requirement.

## **1. Base behavioral expectations**

**1.1 Language basics**: 

Sarcastic, condescending, insulting or racist remarks during discussions must be avoided. 
All contributions and concerns must be addressed with professionalism.

Public comments or actions that impact LBA's image or partnerships, including hostile or divisive rhetoric, must be avoided and will be met with consequences based on their severity.

For sensitive matters, designated mediators or private channels to discuss feedback constructively should be used.


**1.2 Criticism dealings**

Disagreements must be addressed clearly and respectfully within LBA spaces.
- Cryptic messages, passive-aggressive comments, or contribution to unresolved tensions through social media or external groups must be avoided.
- Any opinion is welcome. Members must not retaliate for expressing differing opinions or constructive criticism and should respect all voices within the group.

Criticism must remain factual, constructive, and focused on improvement.
- It must not be used to disparage, demean, or escalate personal conflicts, either publicly or privately.

Feedback must be actionable and shared constructively in public LBA channels, with the aim to improve group initiatives in support of LBA's goals.


**1.3 Grievances & conflicts**

Each member must focus on solutions, collaboration, and forward movement rather than personal disagreements.

Members must not use the LBA as a platform to revisit personal grievances unless tied to actionable, group-relevant outcomes.

Persistent hidden animosity or unresolved conflicts must be mediated to maintain group harmony.



## **2. Collaborative expectations**

**2.1 Success through unity, not division**:

Creating or reinforcing “in-groups” or factions within the LBA should be avoided to ensure collaboration across all members in advancing group goals.

Exclusionary behaviors, cliques, or labeling members as outsiders will not be tolerated. 
Everyone aligned with the group’s mission must feel encouraged to participate productively.


**2.2 Discussion behaviors**

Discussions should be led with a focus on resolving issues constructively.

Discussions and actions must align with the shared mission of the LBA to advance the LUKSO ecosystem. 
Prolonged debates or personal grievances that detract from group objectives should be avoided.


**2.3 Transparent participation**

Members must participate openly during weekly group calls and meetings. If participation is not possible, the team must be informed.

Anonymity is discouraged to foster authentic and accountable interactions.

LBA members should demonstrate a verifiable history of engagement in Web3 ecosystems, such as activity on chat platforms, social media, Universal Profiles, Github contributions, or similar indicators of participation.



## **3. Enforcement**

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed as follows:

SHOULD violations are optional and will be reviewed by the LBA. 
If they accumulate, they may be treated as MUST violations through LBA consensus.

MUST violations result in following incremental offense levels and can result in removal:

1. **Informal Reminder**: Minor issues will result in a private reminder to adjust behavior. These reminders must be communicated as such to prevent misunderstandings. Reminders not communicated as such, are invalid.
2. **Mediation**: Repeated or significant violations will be mediated by a designated party within the group to resolve conflicts constructively.
3. **Warning**; Repeated violations after mediations will result in a warning. A repeated warning within the same month will result in an immediate removal.
4. **Removal**: Persistent or severe breaches will result in permanent removal from the LBA, without the chance to rejoin.


**Extraordinary removal**

Members of the LBA must be permanently removed without the possibility of rejoining under the following circumstances:
- Racist remarks towards LBA members.
- Verbal insults, threats, physical altercations, or conspiracies against fellow LBA members.
- Theft from LBA members.
- Deliberate sabotage of LBA members, tasks or projects.

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, the LBA will foster a professional, respectful, and productive environment that supports the growth of the LUKSO ecosystem.

Godspeed builders and let's create greatness.
