# **LBA Code of Conduct**

This Code of Conduct establishes the standards for professionalism, transparency, and collaboration within the LBA. It is designed to address previous challenges and ensure a respectful and productive environment for all members.

---

## **Key Behavioral Expectations**

- **No Mocking or Dismissive Language**: Avoid sarcastic or condescending remarks during discussions. Respect all contributions and address issues with professionalism.
- **Resolve Historical Tensions**: Members must not use the LBA as a platform to revisit personal grievances without tying them to actionable, group-relevant outcomes.
- **Focus on Collaboration, Not Division**: Avoid creating or reinforcing “in-groups” or factions within the LBA. Collaboration across all members is key to advancing group goals.

---

## **1. Transparent Participation**

- Members must participate openly during weekly group calls and meetings.
- Anonymity is discouraged to foster authentic and accountable interactions.
- LBA members should demonstrate a verifiable history of engagement in Web3 ecosystems, such as activity on chat platforms, social media, Universal Profiles, Github contributions, or similar indicators of participation.

---

## **2. Direct and Respectful Communication**

- Address disagreements clearly and respectfully within LBA spaces. Avoid cryptic messages, passive-aggressive comments, or indirect conflicts through social media or external groups.
- Persistent hidden animosity, including unresolved conflicts, will be mediated. Repeated offenses may result in removal.
- Engage in discussions with a focus on resolving issues constructively. Avoid escalating tensions through dismissive or mocking language.

---

## **3. Professionalism Toward Other Members and Projects**

- Criticism of other members or projects must remain factual and constructive. Publicly or privately disparaging others without basis is prohibited.
- Avoid bringing past personal grievances into current discussions unless directly relevant to group objectives.
- Violations of this rule will result in immediate action to preserve professionalism and group cohesion.

---

## **4. Constructive Feedback**

- All feedback must be actionable and shared constructively in public LBA channels. Feedback should aim to improve group initiatives and further the LBA’s goals.
- Avoid using criticism as a tool to demean others or escalate personal conflicts.
- For sensitive matters, use designated mediators or private channels to discuss feedback constructively.

---

## **5. Focus on Productivity and Shared Goals**

- Discussions and actions must align with the shared mission of the LBA to advance the LUKSO ecosystem. Avoid prolonged debates or personal grievances that detract from group objectives.
- Keep the focus on solutions, collaboration, and progress rather than personal disagreements.
- Avoid public comments or actions that could harm the group’s reputation or partnerships, including hostile or divisive rhetoric.

---

## **6. No Retaliation or Exclusion**

- Members must not retaliate against others for expressing differing opinions or constructive criticism. Respect all voices within the group.
- Exclusionary behaviors, cliques, or labeling members as outsiders will not be tolerated. Everyone who aligns with the group’s mission should feel encouraged to participate productively.

---

## **7. Enforcement**

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed as follows:

1. **Informal Reminder**: Minor issues will result in a private reminder to adjust behavior.
2. **Mediation**: Repeated or significant violations will be mediated by a designated party within the group to resolve conflicts constructively.
3. **Removal**: Persistent or severe breaches will result in permanent removal from the LBA.

---

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, the LBA will foster a professional, respectful, and productive environment that supports the growth of the LUKSO ecosystem.
